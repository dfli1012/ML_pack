\title{Feature Selection with Cox Elastic Net via Stratified Bootstrap Resampling}
\usage{
feature_selection_coxlasso(
  data,
  seed = 123,
  n_round = 20,
  topn = 10,
  lambda_type = "lambda.min"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe where first two columns are survival time and status. Subsequent columns are features.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility (default: 123)}

\item{n_round}{Number of bootstrap resampling rounds (default: 20)}

\item{topn}{Number of top features to retain based on average importance (default: 10)}

\item{lambda_type}{Regularization criterion for cv.glmnet: "lambda.min" (default) or "lambda.1se"}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item selected_matrix - Matrix with survival data and selected features
  \item importance_table - Dataframe of feature rankings by average importance
  \item coef_matrix - Raw coefficient matrix from all resampling rounds
}
}
\description{
Performs feature selection using the Cox proportional hazards model with Elastic Net regularization
through stratified bootstrap resampling. Aggregates feature importance across multiple resampling rounds.
}
\details{
Implements stratified bootstrap resampling preserving event/non-event ratios. Uses Elastic Net
regularization (alpha = 0.5) via glmnet. Feature importance is calculated as mean absolute coefficients
across resampling rounds.

\examples{
\dontrun{
data <- data.frame(time = rnorm(100), status = rbinom(100, 1, 0.5),
                  matrix(rnorm(100*20), ncol=20))
result <- feature_selection_coxlasso(data, topn = 5)
}
