}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe where the first two columns are survival time and status.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility (default: 123)}

\item{train_percent}{Proportion of data to use for training (default: 0.7)}

\item{n_round}{Number of bootstrap rounds for feature selection (default: 20)}

\item{stratify}{Logical indicating whether to use stratified sampling (default: FALSE)}

\item{lambda_type}{Regularization criterion for cv.glmnet: "lambda.min" (default) or "lambda.1se"}

\item{bestcut}{Logical indicating whether to determine optimal cutoff for risk groups (default: FALSE)}

\item{topn}{Number of top features to retain in feature selection (default: 10)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item Training set results with risk scores and groups
  \item Testing set results with risk scores and groups
}
}
\description{
A comprehensive pipeline for survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards model with Elastic Net regularization.
Includes data splitting, feature selection, model training, risk score calculation, and survival curve visualization.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
1. Data preprocessing and splitting
2. Feature selection using Cox LASSO
3. Model training with Elastic Net regularization
4. Risk score calculation and optimal cutoff determination
5. Survival curve visualization and PDF export
