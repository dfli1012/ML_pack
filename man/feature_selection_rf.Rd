\title{Feature Selection using Random Forest with Stratified Bootstrap Resampling}
\usage{
feature_selection_rf(
  data,
  seed = 123,
  n_round = 20,
  topn = 10,
  importance_type = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe or matrix where the first column contains group labels.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility (default: 123)}

\item{n_round}{Number of bootstrap resampling rounds (default: 20)}

\item{topn}{Number of top features to retain (default: 10)}

\item{importance_type}{Type of importance measure: 1 for mean decrease in accuracy,
2 for mean decrease in Gini index (default: 2)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item selected_matrix - Data with selected features and group labels
  \item importance_table - Dataframe of feature rankings by average importance
}
}
\description{
Performs feature selection using Random Forest with stratified bootstrap resampling.
Aggregates feature importance across multiple resampling rounds to identify top features.
}
\details{
Implements stratified bootstrap resampling preserving class proportions. Uses Random Forest
with 500 trees for stability. Feature importance is averaged across resampling rounds and
normalized for comparison.

\examples{
\dontrun{
data <- data.frame(group = sample(0:1, 100, replace = TRUE),
                  matrix(rnorm(100*20), ncol=20))
result <- feature_selection_rf(data, topn = 5)
}
