\usage{
machine_learning(
  data,
  seed = 123,
  group_name = 1,
  train_percent = 0.7,
  n_round = 20,
  topn = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe where the first column contains group labels.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility (default: 123)}

\item{group_name}{Column index or name of the group labels (default: 1)}

\item{train_percent}{Proportion of data to use for training (default: 0.7)}

\item{n_round}{Number of bootstrap rounds for feature selection (default: 20)}

\item{topn}{Number of top features to retain in feature selection (default: 10)}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing AUC values for each model (glmnet, svm, rf, nnet).
}
\description{
A comprehensive pipeline for training and evaluating multiple machine learning models for classification tasks.
Includes data splitting, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
1. Data preprocessing and splitting into training and testing sets.
2. Feature selection using Random Forest.
3. Training and evaluation of four models: glmnet (logistic regression), svm (support vector machine),
   rf (random forest), and nnet (neural network).
4. Generation of ROC curves, confusion matrices, and model importance tables.
5. Export of results, including model parameters, predictions, and visualizations.
